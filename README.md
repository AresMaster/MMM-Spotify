# MMM-Spotify

## TODO
- Spotify Connect. (Impossible without Raspotify on Raspberry Pi at this moment. Damn Widevine missing!!!)
- Change connected devices by condition. (Like, when you are coming home, automatically changing device to Raspotify)
- Control current spotify player with notification
- Display Track info
- Play spotify_uri by notification. (Your playlist, 90's hit..., specific song...)
- Search and play.
